# Automatically-Opened-and-Closed-Popup-Window-with-Infinite-Loop-
You'll put links, you want to popup to. There will be two buttons, "start" and "close". First time you click the start button,your browser will stop popup. Then you have to do "allow popups" just once, and then all the links will be visited automatically. Just by opening and closing popup windows one after another. Also this process will continue for good, until you press the "stop" button. It will be used as an "add-on" to any website. I'm just providing the proper codes!
